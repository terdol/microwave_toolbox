What we have:

- Equations for thick CPWG without dielectric     * Usual equations for
  thin CPW     * Correction for metal thickness
- Equations for thin CPWG with dielectric

Assumptions:

- Quasistatic approximation
- Additional capacitance due to thick metal is the same for the cases
  with and without dielectric
- Dielectric does not have magnetic properties so that line inductance
  does not change with dielectric

Basic equations: \[ v = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}} \]
\[ Z = \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}} \] \[ \Rightarrow C=\frac{1}{Zv}\] where \(v\)
is phase velocity

Let \(c\)=speed of light

For air dielectric; \[C=\frac{1}{cZ\_{thin,air}}\]
\[C+C\_x=\frac{1}{cZ\_{thick,air}}\]
\[\Rightarrow C\_x=\frac{1}{cZ\_{thick,air}}-\frac{1}{cZ\_{thin,air}}\]
where \(C\_x\) is the extra capacitance due to the thickness of the
strip.

This capacitance is the result of 3 factors. Parallel-plate capacitance
between the line and side ground (\(C\_p\)) and fringing fields above
the line (\(C\_{f,above}\)) and below the line (\(C\_{f,below}\)).

\[C\_p = 2\epsilon\_r \epsilon\_0 \frac{t\_h}{s}\]

We assume that: \[ C\_{f,above}=C\_{f,below}=C\_f\]
\[\Rightarrow C\_x=2C\_f+C\_p\]

In the presence of dielectric, only \(C\_{f,below}\) is multiplied by
\(\epsilon\_r\). So the additional capacitance due to thickness in the
presence of dielectric is: \[C\_{x,diel}=(1+\epsilon\_r)C\_f+C\_p\]

For CPW with dielectric and thin metal;
\[C\_{thin,diel}=\frac{1}{v\_{thin}Z\_{thin,diel}}\]
\[L\_{thin}=\frac{Z\_{thin,diel}}{v\_{thin}}\]

For CPW with dielectric and thick metal;
\[L\_{thick}=\frac{Z\_{thick,air}}{c}\]
\[v\_{thick}=\frac{1}{L\_{thick}(C\_{thin,diel}+C\_{x,diel})}\]
\[Z\_{thick,diel}=\frac{L\_{thick}}{(C\_{thin,diel}+C\_{x,diel})}\]
